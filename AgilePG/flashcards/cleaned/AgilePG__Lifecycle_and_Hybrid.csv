AgilePG::Lifecycle & Hybrid,"As project {{c1::uncertainty}} increases, so too does the risk of rework and the need to use a different approach.",,Agile::Lifecycle::Hybrid,Cloze,
AgilePG::Lifecycle & Hybrid,"To mitigate the impact of these risks, teams select {{c1::life cycles}} that allow them to tackle projects with high amounts of uncertainty via small increments of work.",,Agile::Lifecycle::Hybrid,Cloze,
AgilePG::Lifecycle & Hybrid,"When teams deliver {{c1::small increments}}, they are better able to understand the true customer requirements faster and more accurately than with a static written specification.",,Agile::Lifecycle::Incremental,Cloze,
AgilePG::Lifecycle & Hybrid,Your team is building a product with unclear requirements and high technical uncertainty. You expect frequent customer input and iteration. What life cycle approach is most appropriate?,Agile or hybrid,Agile::Lifecycle::Hybrid,Basic,
AgilePG::Lifecycle & Hybrid,"A regulatory compliance project has clearly defined deliverables, a fixed timeline, and limited customer input. What life cycle is most appropriate?",Predictive,Agile::Lifecycle::Predictive,Basic,
AgilePG::Lifecycle & Hybrid,"A software team can release parts of their product to users every two weeks for feedback, even if the full system isn't ready. What delivery style does this reflect?",Incremental,Agile::Lifecycle::Incremental,Basic,
AgilePG::Lifecycle & Hybrid,"Your team is developing a complex new interface. The full product won't be delivered until the end, but you expect to refine the design through rounds of feedback and evolving understanding. What life cycle is most appropriate?",Iterative,Agile::Lifecycle::Iterative,Basic,
AgilePG::Lifecycle & Hybrid,What life cycles 'take advantage of things that are known and proven'?,Predictive life cycles,Agile::Lifecycle::Predictive,Basic,
AgilePG::Lifecycle & Hybrid,What life cycles 'allow feedback on partially completed or unfinished work to improve and modify that work'?,Iterative life cycles,Agile::Lifecycle::Iterative,Basic,
AgilePG::Lifecycle & Hybrid,What life cycles 'provide finished deliverables that the customer may be able to use immediately'?,Incremental life cycles,Agile::Lifecycle::Incremental,Basic,
AgilePG::Lifecycle & Hybrid,What life cycles 'leverage both the aspects of iterative and incremental characteristics'?,Agile life cycles,Agile::Lifecycle::Hybrid,Basic,
AgilePG::Lifecycle & Hybrid,What agile life cycle is described? 'The team works in timeboxes of equal duration to deliver completed features'?,Iteration-Based Agile,Agile::Lifecycle::Iterative,Basic,
AgilePG::Lifecycle & Hybrid,What agile life cycle is described? 'The team pulls features from the backlog based on its capacity to start work'?,Flow-Based Agile,Agile::Lifecycle::Flow,Basic,
AgilePG::Lifecycle & Hybrid,"{{c1::Iteration-based Agile}} uses fixed-length timeboxes, while Flow-based Agile delivers continuously based on capacity.",,Agile::Lifecycle::Iterative Cloze,,

AgilePG::Lifecycle & Hybrid,"A combination of predictive, iterative, incremental, and/or agile approaches is a {{c1::hybrid approach}}.",,Agile::Lifecycle::Hybrid,Cloze,
AgilePG::Lifecycle & Hybrid,The goal of {{c1::project management}} is to produce business value in the best possible way given the current environment.,,Agile::Lifecycle::Hybrid,Cloze,
AgilePG::Lifecycle & Hybrid,Agile is about {{c1::customer-based}} delivery on a frequent basis.,,Agile::Lifecycle::Incremental,Cloze,
